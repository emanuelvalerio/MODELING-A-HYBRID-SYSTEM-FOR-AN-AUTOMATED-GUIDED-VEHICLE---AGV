# MODELING-A-HYBRID-SYSTEM-FOR-AN-AUTOMATED-GUIDED-VEHICLE---AGV
This project aims to model a hybrid system in the simulink of an AGV to follow a given trajectory.

1. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Initially, the schematic was set up in the stateflow with the state machine, together with the Robot Vizualizer block from the mobile robotics toolbox, for the design of the trajectory presented in the statement, a waypoints block was also used from the mobile robotics toolbox to draw the points of the trajectory on which the AGV(“Automated Guided Vehicle”) should follow, these same points used for 2D display were used as reference points in the error calculation function in the stateflow. It is possible to analyze the organization of the modeling in Figure 01.
